## Overview

**Orbservability** is a next-generation observability platform designed to provide in-depth analysis and visualization of your applications' call graph. By leveraging the power of both graph and time series databases, we offer unparalleled insight into how functions and methods within your application interact over time.

### Features

- **Deep Dive Into Relationships**

    Understand the intricate relationships between functions, methods, and services in your application.
  
- **Time Series Analysis**

    Track key metrics such as latency, error rate, and call frequency over time to identify trends, spikes, or anomalies.
  
- **Optimized Storage**

    Utilize the strengths of specialized databases: graph databases for structural representation and time series databases for timestamped metrics.
  
- **Interactive Visualization**

    Visualize both the structure of your call graph and the evolution of metrics over time in one cohesive interface.

- **Runtime Analysis**

    Monitor active code paths and accurately identify "cruft" that can be safely removed once compared with static code analysis.
  
- **Automated Observability**

    Achieve comprehensive observability without the hassle of manual instrumentation.

### Value

In today's complex software landscape, understanding how different parts of your applications interact is crucial. Orbservability goes beyond traditional monitoring tools by not only providing a historical context but also visualizing the structural relationships of your distributed system. Dive deep into your application's behavior, optimize performance, and ensure reliability with Orbservability.
